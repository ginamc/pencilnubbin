  THE BIG EASY
  <a class="anchor" href="#the-big-easy">#</a>
</h2>
<p>In October 2022, I flew to New Orleans to attend a three-day conference. I spent as much time as I could outside between sessions, walking around the Big Easy. I mostly stayed in the French Quarter to stay close to the conference site. New Orleans definitely requires another visit and my full attention.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="an-old-feeling">
  An old feeling
  <a class="anchor" href="#an-old-feeling">#</a>
</h3>
<p>As I rode the airport shuttle and watched the scenery go by, I felt an oldness. New Orleans is old. The land felt old. The energy of the landscape was weathered but not tired. It was lived-in. That feeling was a constant throughout my stay but was profound along the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t quite describe what I felt. The closest analogy, maybe, is if you ever went camping or you&rsquo;re out in the woods and you pause on the trail and just &ldquo;soak it all in.&rdquo; You feel the energy of the land. That&rsquo;s what NoLa was like. But ancient. Old.</p>
<p>

<p>I arrived on a balmy Sunday afternoon in late October. After shaking the frigid shell of airplane-cold-air from my skin, I made my way to the shuttle. The driver extended her hand for my suitcase which she placed in the back of the shuttle. She then took my very narrow, horizontal ticket and ushered me onto the vehicle. Crowded. I wondered if any of these folks were going to the same conference but I didn&rsquo;t ask because I was suffering from a bout of motion sickness. And hunger.</p>
<h3 class="heading" id="dinner-and-bourbon">
  Dinner and Bourbon
  <a class="anchor" href="#dinner-and-bourbon">#</a>
</h3>
<p>As soon as I checked into the hotel, I went to get dinner. The motion sickness was subsiding but food would help rid of it completely.</p>
<p>Bourbon Street. Lively. Raucous. Vibrant. It is a&hellip; happy place, though perhaps &ldquo;happy&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t quite the right word. Happy, yes, the people appear happy but maybe &ldquo;without a care&rdquo; is more befitting the scene. Bourbon Street, at night, is where you go to live in the moment. Just you and a plastic vessel (or few) of liquid delirium.</p>

  NoLa is texture

</h2>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I&rsquo;d find when I came to the Big Easy. I was hoping to see many of the original colonial French and Spanish architectural styles but they were mixed with the contemporary structures of artless and dull rectangles in comparison.</p>
<p>They really don&rsquo;t make them like this anymore.</p>
<p>Sadly, it seems that after the Louisiana Purchase, much of these original styles were lost. Renovations were done in the Victorian style or destroyed in the fires of 1788 and 1794. Some of these structures were rebuilt in the &ldquo;second generation&rdquo; Creole or Greek revival styles.</p>
<p>For the remaining buildings that did retain some of their old artistic elements, one thing was for certain: texture. New Orleans was full of it.
The historic Beaux Arts Maison Blanche building</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now a Ritz-Carlton but the 1908 Beaux Arts building retains its antebellum charms. I noticed the columns first. The spiraling detail that scoops vertically, bookended by floral-like horizontal bands. As the eye travelled upward, as though gazing upon the exposed legs of a woman, geometric shapes revealed themselves intricately cut to provide depth and stateliness. Maybe it was the way the sun hit the building at that moment but the shadows gave the edges an oxymoronic soft sharpness you don&rsquo;t often find in more contemporary structures.</p>
